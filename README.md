# Time Scheduler

This is a Django-based project that implements a **monthly payment processing system** for students with payment plans. It includes functionality for scheduling tasks using **Celery** and **Celery Beat**, as well as unit tests to validate the payment processing logic.

---

## Features

- **Student Management**: Create and manage students with account balances.
- **Payment Plans**: Define monthly payment plans for students, including start and end dates, and monthly fees.
- **Automated Payment Processing**: Automatically deduct fees from student balances on a monthly basis using Celery tasks.
- **Task Scheduling**: Schedule recurring tasks with Celery Beat.
- **Testing**: Unit tests are included to ensure the functionality of the payment processing system.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Django**: Backend framework for managing models and business logic.
- **Celery**: Task queue for asynchronous task processing.
- **Celery Beat**: Scheduler for periodic tasks.
- **Redis**: Message broker for Celery.
- **Pytest/Django Test Framework**: For writing and running tests.

---

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+** installed.
2. **Redis** installed and running (used as the Celery broker).
3. **Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended).

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd time-scheduler
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run Redis**:
   Make sure Redis is running in the background. You can start it with:
   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

5. **Run Migrations**:
   Apply database migrations to set up the database schema:
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Run the Development Server**:
   Start the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Start Celery**:
   Open a new terminal and start the Celery worker:
   ```bash
   celery -A time_scheduler worker --loglevel=info
   ```

8. **Start Celery Beat**:
   Open another terminal and start Celery Beat for periodic task scheduling:
   ```bash
   celery -A time_scheduler beat --loglevel=info
   ```

---

## Functionality

### 1. **Student and Payment Plan Models**
   - A `Student` model stores the name and balance of each student.
   - A `PaymentPlan` model defines the monthly fee, start date, and end date for each student.

### 2. **Monthly Payment Processing**
   - The `process_monthly_payments` function deducts the monthly fee from the student's balance if sufficient funds are available. If not, it logs a warning.
   - Payments are recorded in the database for each successful transaction.

### 3. **Task Scheduling**
   - Celery Beat is used to schedule the `process_monthly_payments` task to run periodically (e.g., every month).

---

## Testing

Unit tests are included to ensure the functionality of the payment processing system.

1. **Run Tests**:
   To run the tests, use the following command:
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py test
   ```

2. **Example Test Case**:
   - **Test Name**: `test_process_monthly_payments`
   - **Functionality Tested**:
     - Deduction of the monthly fee from the student's balance.
     - Creation of a payment record for each successful transaction.

---

## Example Output

Here’s an example of the log output when the Celery task runs:

```plaintext
[2024-12-16 10:00:00,000: INFO/ForkPoolWorker-1] Task time_schedule.tasks.process_monthly_payments_task succeeded
[2024-12-16 10:00:00,001: WARNING/ForkPoolWorker-1] Insufficient balance for John
```

## Future Improvements

- Add a frontend interface for managing students and payment plans.
- Implement email notifications for insufficient balances.
- Add support for more complex billing schedules (e.g., weekly or yearly).
- Improve test coverage with edge cases and error handling.
